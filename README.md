# 🚀 AI-Powered Email Automation: Camunda 8.7 + Hugging Face + Node.js

**Streamline business communication**: Eliminate manual responses, reduce human error, and speed up turnaround time.
**Deliver personalized replies at scale**: Use context-aware AI to generate targeted, professional email responses.
**Leverage BPMN orchestration**: Employ Camunda 8.7 to maintain auditability, retries, and fault tolerance in an end‑to‑end automated process.

## 🔧 Architecture & Workflow

### Start Event: Inbound Email

Camunda’s **inbound-email connector** polls Gmail via IMAP every 5 seconds for unseen messages. When a new email arrives, the process is triggered.

### Generate AI Reply

A custom **Node.js Zeebe worker** retrieves the email’s sender, subject, and body.
The worker constructs a prompt and calls Hugging Face’s `mistralai/Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407` **chat-completion API** through `@huggingface/inference`.
It returns a professional, context‑aware reply as plain text.

### Send Automated Response

Uses Camunda’s **outbound SMTP connector** to deliver the generated reply to the original sender.
The process ends with Camunda logging the response and completing the workflow.
